update to C++ 20
    replace ##__VA_ARGS__ with __VA_OPT__(,) __VA_ARGS__
    use better format library thingy
    replace std::string with std::string_view where applicable (shader bindings?)
implement Camera2D and abstract Camera class
add IndexBuffer to VertexArray
    similarly, remove from Renderer::Draw
figure out an actual naming convention
    rename folders to be PascalCase (src -> Source), similar to UE, but also more consistent
    in a similar feeling vein, split the engine in public and private folders to prevent access to wrong APIs
