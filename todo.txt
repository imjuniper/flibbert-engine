    following that, should eventually remove ViewProjection from parameters in Renderer::Draw
        actually, look into uniform buffers!
add IndexBuffer to VertexArray
    similarly, remove from Renderer::Draw
figure out an actual naming convention

    in a similar feeling vein, split the engine in public and private folders to prevent access to wrong APIs
