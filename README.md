## Seriously though

Flibbert is basically a small framework/engine that I'm working on to learn game engine development, rendering, C++, etc. I started working on it for a class in my game development program. I have no idea whether I will continue it in the future or if I'll abandon it, but it'll surely be a cool learning experience.

### Current features

- OpenGL backend, with abstractions
- Dear ImGui for UI
- 3D Camera, though it's the only 3D part implemented
- Input/event system
